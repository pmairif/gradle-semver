# gradle-semver

Gradle plugin that reads semantic versioning file ('.semver') generated by semver utility 
([original project][1] or this [fork][2] for example)
and sets the project version.

## Usage

Simply apply the plugin to your gradle build and set dependency from the jar task 
or another task that needs the project version to be set:

```gradle
plugins {
    id 'de.highbyte_le.semver' version '1.0'
}

task printVersion {
    doLast {
        println(project.version)
    }
}
printVersion.dependsOn readSemVer

```

For a java build that would be:
```gradle
plugins {
    id 'java'
    id 'de.highbyte_le.semver' version '1.0'
}

jar.dependsOn readSemVer
```

## Configuration

The .semver file is searched in the project directory. This is configurable.
If you want to use that from the parent directory:
```gradle
semver {
    semverPath = project.layout.projectDirectory.file('../.semver')
}
```
